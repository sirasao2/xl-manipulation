Probes is a complex VNF which comprises of at least 50 different VM types (both backed and front end). There are hundreds of these deployed in production and thousands more are to be deployed. Previously, this team used to change hundreds to thousands of cells per each .xlsm file by hand. After talking to those in that group, sometimes half or more of their days were spent painstakingly editing individual cells sheet by sheet. The Preload Automation Tool which Labs has developed can change hundreds of cells per minute and has almost no degree of error. This not only will save immense resources and time for AT&T, but it will allow a very seamless and mechanized approach to these template edits.
